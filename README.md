hello-cpp-world

Welcome to hello-cpp-world! This repository is a personal chronicle of my journey into the world of C++. It's a collection of small, focused programs that I've written to explore and understand various fundamental concepts in C++. Each file represents a step in my learning process, from the very basics to more intricate topics.
What You'll Find Here

This repository covers a wide array of foundational C++ concepts, reflecting my learning path:
Basic Syntax and Control Flow

These files represent my initial explorations into C++'s core structure and how to control program execution.

    helloworld.cpp: The classic first step in any programming language!

    basic string.cpp: Getting acquainted with string manipulation.

    datatypes.cpp: Understanding different data types in C++.

    even or odd.cpp: A simple program to check if a number is even or odd.

    comparing 3 no .cpp: Learning to compare multiple numbers.

    simple while.cpp: My first steps with while loops.

    while loop.cpp: Further exploration of while loops.

    pswd while.cpp: A simple password checker using a while loop.

    vowel or no.cpp: Checking for vowels.

    weekday.cpp: Determining the day of the week.

Operators and Expressions

Exploring the various operators C++ offers for different operations.

    bitwise operators.cpp: Diving into bit-level operations.

    logical operators.cpp: Understanding AND, OR, and NOT operations.

    calculator.cpp: A basic calculator implementation.

Functions and Recursion

Delving into modular programming and recursive problem-solving.

    call by value_functions.cpp: Understanding function calls by value.

    factorial by recursion.cpp: Calculating factorials using recursion.

    recursion sumup.cpp: Exploring summation with recursion.

    rev int using recursion.cpp: Reversing an integer using recursion.

    rev string recursion.cpp: Reversing a string using recursion.

Arrays and Strings

Working with collections of data and character sequences.

    palindrom.cpp: Checking if a string is a palindrome.

    string concatenate.cpp: Combining strings.

    string reverse.cpp: Reversing a string.

    rev_an_int.cpp: Reversing an integer (likely a non-recursive approach).

Error Handling and Advanced Concepts

Venturing into more robust programming practices and specific functionalities.

    age checker using catch&throw.cpp: Implementing basic error handling with try-catch for age validation.

    divide_by_zero.cpp: Handling division by zero scenarios.

    set reset bit manipulation.cpp: Manipulating individual bits.

    to check what quadrant a pair of coordinates b...: Determining the quadrant of coordinates.

    grade assignement.cpp: A program for assigning grades.

Pattern Printing

Fun exercises to build logic and loops.

    flipped flyod.cpp: Printing a flipped Floyd's triangle pattern.

    floyd series.cpp: Generating Floyd's triangle.

    rev pyramid.cpp: Printing a reverse pyramid pattern.

    rev star pyr.cpp: Printing a reverse star pyramid.

    star pyramid.cpp: Printing a star pyramid.

Swapping

Different methods of exchanging values.

    swapping by call by val.cpp: Swapping values using call by value (though actual swap typically requires pointers/references).

How to Explore My Journey

Each .cpp file in this repository is a standalone program. To see them in action:

    Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/hello-cpp-world.git

    Navigate to the directory:

    cd hello-cpp-world

    Compile and Run: Use a C++ compiler (like g++) to compile any file, then run the executable. For example, to run helloworld.cpp:

    g++ helloworld.cpp -o helloworld
    ./helloworld

    This will create an executable file named helloworld (or helloworld.exe on Windows), which you can then run to see the program's output.

My Ongoing Learning

This repository is a testament to my continuous learning in C++. I'm always adding new examples as I explore more complex topics and refine my understanding. Feel free to browse, learn, and even suggest improvements!
